# CelesteTAS v3.44.1, Studio v3.9.1

- Fix: Crash on first start-up on Windows

# CelesteTAS v3.44.0, Studio v3.9.0

## Radeline Simulator

The Radeline Simulator is a tool created by Kataiser, which allows for brute-forcing inputs to get the player into a specific subpixel position.  
With it now being integrated into Studio, it can easily access the game's data and provide fast results.

It can be found under `Tools -> Radeline Simulator`.

## Better Accessibility Tools

Some maps choose to prevent user from using certain accessibility tools (like the Debug Map), to avoid the users from accidentally ruining their experience while playing the map.  
However these accessibility tools are often useful when playing the map not as a casual playthrough, such as routing a TAS/Speedrun.

By default, these features will now be forcefully re-enabled while Studio is connected to the game, to give users the option back.  
It can also be always enabled or disabled.

This also includes annoying events, like crashing / restarting the game.

---

## Improved SkinMod Support

SkinMods are known to sometimes change the length of certain animations to better fit the artists intention.  
However these changes can cause desyncs and confusion, because the TAS expects a different length than it actually is.

Now, it will apply vanilla animation lengths and metadata, while maintaining the SkinMod's visual style as best as it can.  
If a map requires a SkinMod, this fix will not be applied.

Please report any cases of this feature not working as intended.

## `RealTime` Timing Command

With the rise in interest for some to time TASes using real-time, this commands now provides an easy way to do that.  
It'll count everything from the point 'Begin' is pressed, only excluded real loading times.

It will be filled in, when the TAS ends, just like the `FileTime` command works currently.

When a `RealTime` command is detected in the file, an additional 'Real Timer' will appear in the Info HUD to display the current real time.

## Reworked Target-Query System

Target-Queries are the system used by `Set`/`Invoke`-Commands and Custom Info.  
They already supported limiting to specific Entity IDs with `Query[Room:ID]` and querying components with `Query:ComponentType`, 
however these only worked on the base type.  
Now they can be specified anywhere, even on members.

Additionally, lists can now be accessed in "parallel", meaning you could now do the following for example:  
`Set, Player:Leader.Followers.Entity.Golden, True` to set all carried berries by the player to be golden berries.

You can now also get auto-complete for parameter values of commands, for example:  
`Set, Player.StateMachine.State, Player.StNormal`

---

## Breakpoint Editing

Similar to the editing experience with regular inputs, breakpoints are now treated the same way.  
It is now impossible to have an invalid breakpoint in a TAS file; it either needs to be valid or not there.

This might break a bit of muscle memory at first, but it should be quick to get used to.  
Additionally, these changes sound more drastic than they actually are.
